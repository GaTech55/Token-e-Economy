## Description

This application was created to provide clinical support for a token economy system. The user registers as either a clinician or a parent. A registered user is able to create, update and delete tasks and rewards. As a child completes a task, he or she receives a token for the amount that the user chooses which is then added to the total token amount displayed on the task and rewards pages. When a child wants to redeem a reward that token amount is then subtracted from the total tokens. Clinician notes are added to each task. The token amount for completed tasks by each user is is displayed in the chart on the dashboard page. The communication page allows for the parent user to be able to send an email to the clinician.
